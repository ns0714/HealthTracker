# HealthTracker

1 - How many times have you thought of sharing what has been keeping you healthy with your friends or wished if there was a way your friends could suggest to you what has been working for them?

2 - If you have one of the common health conditions like diabetes or hypertension wouldn't you wish there was an easier way to keep you on top of your diet and excercise to better manage those conditions?

With HealthTracker users would be able to share and suggest their health and fitness related information with their friends. If you have a health condition and you would like to connect with people that have the same health condition and would like to know and get yourself motivated to adopt healthy life choices and what has been working for others. HealthTracker would allow users to record their health condition related information and share with friends. This way people can see what has been working for others and how their own efforts compare to others.
